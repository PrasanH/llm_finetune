This is a compilation of parallel corpora resources used in building of Machine Translation engines in NTEU project (Action number: 2018-EU-IA-0051). Data in these resources are compiled in two TMX files, two tiers grouped by data source reliablity. Tier A -- data originating from human edited sources, translation memories and alike. Tier B -- data originating created by automatic aligning parallel data from miscellaneous web and parallel documents sources. This resource contains Tier A only.

The subsequent sections list all the sources contained in this parallel corpus.
